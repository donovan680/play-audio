# play-audio
This is a demo for decoding audio. It supports mp3 and ogg, but does not seem to support aac and m4a.
The decoding part comes from 0x40.mon.im,the github is  https://github.com/mon/0x40-web.

    1. Install Node.js;
    
    2. node .\httpserver.js;
    
    3. request.open('GET', 'mario.mp3', true);    //choose your audio in index.js;
